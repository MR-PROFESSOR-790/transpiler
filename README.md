# 🚀 Sol2RISC-V: Solidity to RISC-V Transpiler

This project is a transpiler that converts Solidity smart contracts into RISC-V assembly code. It aims to bridge the gap between the Ethereum ecosystem and the RISC-V architecture, enabling developers to run Solidity contracts on RISC-V processors.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### 📋 Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   RISC-V Toolchain (for compiling and running the output)

### ⚙️ Installation

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/sol2risc-v.git
    cd sol2risc-v
    ```
2.  Install the package:
    *   If you have `pip`, you can install it directly:
        ```bash
        pip install .
        ```
    *   Alternatively, you can build a wheel first and then install it:
        ```bash
        python -m build --wheel
        pip install dist/sol2riscv-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
        ```
        (Note: The wheel filename might vary depending on the exact version and build.)

### ▶️ Usage

1.  Prepare your Solidity contract (e.g., `MyContract.sol`).
2.  Run the transpiler:
    ```bash
    python src/transpiler/main.py MyContract.sol output.asm
    ```
    (Adjust the command based on the actual entry point and arguments of the script)
3.  Compile the generated RISC-V assembly code using your RISC-V toolchain:
    ```bash
    riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -o output.elf output.asm
    ```
4.  Run the compiled contract on a RISC-V simulator or hardware.

## 🛠️ How it Works

The Sol2RISC-V transpiler follows these general steps:

1.  📜 **Parsing Solidity Code:** The input Solidity smart contract is first parsed to understand its structure and semantics. (Currently, this might involve parsing EVM bytecode if the transpiler works from bytecode).
2.  🔍 **EVM Bytecode Analysis (If applicable):** If the transpiler works from EVM bytecode, this stage involves disassembling and analyzing the bytecode.
3.  🔄 **Opcode Mapping:** EVM opcodes (from Solidity compilation) are mapped to equivalent sequences of RISC-V instructions. This is a crucial part of the transpilation logic.
4.  🧠 **Register Allocation:** Efficiently manage the usage of RISC-V registers for storing variables and intermediate results.
5.  💾 **Memory Model Management:** Implement Solidity's memory and storage models within the RISC-V environment.
6.  💻 **RISC-V Code Generation:** Finally, the transpiler emits RISC-V assembly code that corresponds to the input Solidity contract.

The core components involved are:
*   🧩 **EVM Parser (`evm_parser.py`):** Handles the initial processing of EVM bytecode.
*   🧩 **Opcode Mapping Logic (`opcode_mapping.py`):** Contains the rules for converting EVM opcodes to RISC-V instructions.
*   🧩 **RISC-V Emitter (`riscv_emitter.py`):** Generates the final RISC-V assembly code.
*   🧩 **Register Allocator (`register_allocator.py`):** Manages register usage.
*   🧩 **Memory Model (`memory_model.py`):** Implements memory operations.
